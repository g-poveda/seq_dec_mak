# Welcome

This is an introduction course to scheduling problems and how to solve them using either heuristic or mathematical methods (mainly Constraint programming based).

Main dependencies will be deal by installing the discrete-optimization library to your preferred environment.
```
pip install discrete-optimisation
```

- Introduction course is given in course_material/*.pdf, along with a CheatSheet to use OrtoolsCPSat solver
- Notebooks are then numbered in a logical order.

Good luck ! 
To go further on solving scheduling problems : 
- you can follow the different tutorials/Colab notebooks in https://airbus.github.io/discrete-optimization/master/notebooks.html#introduction-to-rcpsp.
- To improve your skills on CPSat solver : you can go through the extensive examples in the library github repo :
    - https://github.com/google/or-tools/tree/stable/examples/python
    - Go through the full guide : https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp/cp_solver, and notably on the scheduling focused examples (https://developers.google.com/optimization/scheduling)
